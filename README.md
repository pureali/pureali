### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a Computer Science (CS) Researcher with a solid foundation in CS (BS,MS,PhD) and five years of professional software development experience. I am looking to collaborate on applied machine learning, including agentic AI and LLMs. My research interests include digital twins, computer vision, extended reality, intelligent multi-agents and video stream analytics.

**pureali/pureali** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a digital twin to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning agentic AI with MCPs
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on multi-agents, computer vision, extended reality, sand tartup ideas
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with marketing and brainstorming ideas
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about technical issues, ideas, and research interests 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: pureali@G M A I L
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He, Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I ran a marathon in Budapest in 2024 and completed it in 4:42
     I am the founder of a chat tool based on the IRC protocol called NetIRC
